# Assessment 1 (HTML, CSS)

### 1. Task 1 - Static, fixed size page

Build a page that looks identical to [task1/page.png](task1/page.png). The window width you should work with is 2560 x 1838 pixels. You are only allowed to use HTML and CSS for this task. No external libraries are permitted.

Please build your page in [task1/index.html](task1/index.html). You are welcome to create as many CSS files that you need in the `task1` folder for `index.html` to import. When being marked, your tutor will start with `index.html`.

#### Assets

* The asset(s) are provided in `task1/assets` give you the text to put on the page, any images and icons for the page.
* For the heart emoji, you are able to use a reasonable emoji (or image of your choice found online) to display that element.
* The font used on this page should match exactly. The font used is `sans-serif` for the page.

### 2. Task 2 - Static, fixed size page

Build a page that looks identical to [task2/page.png](task2/page.png). The window width you should work with is 975 x 610 pixels. You are only allowed to use HTML and CSS for this task. No external libraries are permitted.

You can assume that all the input fields are `<input />` tags. All non-text inputs do not need any drop down behaviour or dynamic styling when being clicked etc. For text inputs they can be assumed to be static text inputs that have a text of colour `#000000` when text is inputted. None of the text inputs need to deal with text longer than 10 characters.

Please build your page in `task2/index.html`. You are welcome to create as many CSS files that you need in the `task2` folder for `index.html` to import. When being marked, your tutor will start with `index.html`.

#### Assets
* The asset(s) are provided in `task2/assets`.
* The font used on this page should match exactly. The font used is `arial` for the page.

### 3. Task 3 - Responsive, static page

Build a responsive page that complies with [task3/page_big.png](task3/page_big.png) and [task3/page_small.png](task3/page_small.png). The big page is 1552 x 917
pixels, and the small page is 291 x 1068 pixels. Your single page (note that you're not using two separate HTML files) should like identical to either of these pages depending on the window sized the browser is at.

Your are expected to have reasonable intermediate states. In other words, if the window size is some combination of widths between 1552 and 917, combined with some combination of heights between 291 and 1068, the page should still reflect the same general structure.

Please build your page in `task3/index.html`. You are welcome to create as many CSS files that you need in the `task3` folder for `index.html` to import. When being marked, your tutor will start with `index.html`.

#### Assets
* The asset(s) are provided in `task3/assets`.
* The font used on this page should match exactly. The font used is `open-sans` for the page.
